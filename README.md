# -Glucose-Estimator-Colorimetric-Method-
A simple Python tool to estimate glucose concentration in biological samples using the colorimetric method and linear regression. This project helps students and researchers analyze absorbance–concentration relationships and predict unknown glucose levels from standard curve data — all from the command line.
